abstract="An important form of learning from observation is constructing a classification of given objects or situations. Traditional techniques for this purpose, developed in cluster analysis and numerical taxonomy, are often inadequate because they arrange objects into classes solely on the basis of a numerical measure of object similarity. Such a measure is a function only of compared objects and does not take into consideration any global properties or concepts characterizing object classes. Consequently, the obtained classes may have no simple conceptual description and may be difficult to interpret.",

In this paper we present GALOIS, a system that automates and applies this theory. The algorithm utilized by GALOIS to build a concept lattice is incremental and efﬁcient, each update being done in time at most quadratic in the number of objects in the lattice. Also, the algorithm may incorporate background information into the lattice, and through clustering, extend the scope of the theory. The application we present is concerned with information retrieval via browsing, for which we argue that concept lattices may represent major support structures. We describe a prototype user interface for browsing through the concept lattice of a document-term relation, possibly enriched with a thesaurus of terms. An experimental evaluation of the system performed on a medium-sized bibliographic database shows good retrieval performance and a signiﬁcant improvement after the introduction of background knowledge.},

	abstract = {We introduce the notion of iceberg concept lattices and show their use in knowledge discovery in databases. Iceberg lattices are a conceptual clustering method, which is well suited for analyzing very large databases. They also serve as a condensed representation of frequent itemsets, as starting point for computing bases of association rules, and as a visualization method for association rules. Iceberg concept lattices are based on the theory of Formal Concept Analysis, a mathematical theory with applications in data analysis, information retrieval, and knowledge discovery. We present a new algorithm called TITANIC for computing (iceberg) concept lattices. It is based on data mining techniques with a level-wise approach. In fact, TITANIC can be used for a more general problem: Computing arbitrary closure systems when the closure operator comes along with a so-called weight function. The use of weight functions for computing closure systems has not been discussed in the literature up to now. Applications providing such a weight function include association rule mining, functional dependencies in databases, conceptual clustering, and ontology engineering. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated and compared with Ganter’s Next-Closure algorithm. The evaluation shows an important gain in eﬃciency, especially for weakly correlated data.

abstract = {Outstanding frequent pattern mining guarantees both fast runtime and low memory usage with respect to various data with different types and sizes. However, it is hard to improve the two elements since runtime is inversely proportional to memory usage in general. Researchers have made efforts to overcome the problem and have proposed mining methods which can improve both through various approaches. Many of state-of-the-art mining algorithms use tree structures, and they create nodes independently and connect them as pointers when constructing their own trees. Accordingly, the methods have pointers for each node in the trees, which is an inefficient way since they should manage and maintain numerous pointers. In this paper, we propose a novel tree structure to solve the limitation. Our new structure, LP-tree (Linear Prefix – Tree) is composed of array forms and minimizes pointers between nodes. In addition, LP-tree uses minimum information required in mining process and linearly accesses corresponding nodes. We also suggest an algorithm applying LP-tree to the mining process. The algorithm is evaluated through various experiments, and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous algorithms in term of the runtime, memory, and scalability.}

	abstract = {Algorithms for the computer aided assessment of students' knowledge frequently operate on a structure called a knowledge space. The generation of a knowledge space often requires computing the closure of a family of subsets of a given set under union; unfortunately, however, the number of unions thus generated may grow exponentially with the number of subsets. It follows that algorithmic efficiency is of paramount importance. In this paper we present an algorithm based on specific members of a family of subsets of a finite set that eliminates redundant computation. thereby obtaining optimal efficiency. This algorithm is called the irredundant algorithm. The irredundant algorithm was applied to generating knowledge spaces from two different branches of knowledge, and to determining the size of these spaces. It is shown that the size of a knowledge space is an important characteristic of the structure of knowledge in a given area. For the same field of knowledge, in practice, we may obtain different knowledge spaces. It is shown that the irredundant algorithm can be used to intergrate different knowledge spaces into a common knowledge space. This procedure is illustrated with the example of two knowledge spaces on elementary reading and writing abilities.},

	abstract = {Galois lattices and formal concept analysis of binary relations have proved useful in the resolution of many problems of theoretical or practical interest. Recent studies of practical applications in data mining and software engineering have put the emphasis on the need for both efficient and flexible algorithms to construct the lattice. Our paper presents a novel approach for lattice construction based on the apposition of binary relation fragments. We extend the existing theory to a complete characterization of the global Galois (concept) lattice as a substructure of the direct product of the lattices related to fragments. The structural properties underlie a procedure for extracting the global lattice from the direct product, which is the basis for a full-scale lattice construction algorithm implementing a divide-and-conquer strategy. The paper provides a complexity analysis of the algorithm together with some results about its practical performance and describes a class of binary relations for which the algorithm outperforms the most efficient lattice-constructing methods.},

The complexity of generating a concept lattice puts a constraint to the applicability of software systems. In this paper we report on some attempts to evaluate simple FCA-based classiﬁcation algorithms. We present an experimental study of several benchmark datasets using FCA-based approaches. We discuss diﬃculties we encountered and make some suggestions concerning concept-based classiﬁcation algorithms.},

        abstract = {{\ensuremath{<}}p{\ensuremath{>}}This paper presents an algorithm, called In-Close, that uses incremental closure and matrix searching to quickly compute all formal concepts in a formal context. In-Close is based, conceptually, on a well known algorithm called Close-By-One. The serial version of a recently published algorithm (Krajca, 2008) was shown to be in the order of 100 times faster than several well-known algorithms, and timings of other algorithms in reviews suggest that none of them are faster than Krajca. This paper compares In-Close to Krajca, discussing computational methods, data requirements and memory considerations. From experiments using several public data sets and random data, this paper shows that In-Close is in the order of 20 times faster than Krajca. In-Close is small, straightforward, requires no matrix pre-processing and is simple to implement.{\ensuremath{<}}/p{\ensuremath{>}}}
